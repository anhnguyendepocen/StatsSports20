## Important note 2

Second, we'll be using R Markdown for *all* of our class labs and homeworks. 

R Markdown simultaneously stores your commands, executes your commands, and generates an output file automatically, we will use R Markdown files to store our code and answers for *all* Lab and Homework assignments.
    
Open a new R Markdown file (File / New File / R Markdown...).  You can create a basic name -- HW0, for example -- and that'll set you up with a new file ready to go. The preferred output for HW and labs is HTML. 

## Important note 3

You can change the title, author, and date to be whatever you want
